To be able to understand the basics of requesting data from server using
fetch API (Method Get and POST) or XMLRequest,you have to implement a 
server, which have some database, then you request data from it.

The easiest way to implement server is to use Python.
the code is free on the internet.

but i made some modifications.

my aim was to understand the fetch GET and POST using a server using json format.

so you can find HTML file for javascript

and python file for server with output json format
